# Replit-stuff
Moving stuff on replit to GitHub now

Currently, Replit is going crazy! It doesn't allow users to create more than 3 repls! As such, I moved most of my repls before 2024/9/22 to GitHub. You can go to the folder in the repository with similar name as the repl. If you don't see one, that means that the repl is only used for testing and isn't worth being preserved.
